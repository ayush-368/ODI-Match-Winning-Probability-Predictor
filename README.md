# ODI-Match-Winning-Probability-Predictor
This project predicts the winning probability of a odi match in second inning using current situation of the match.
It takes some inputs like batting team, bowling team, target, current score, overs etc.
I took data of ODI matches from kaggle and after some processing on this data train a model using RandomForestClassifier.
