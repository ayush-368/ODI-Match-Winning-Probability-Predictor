This machine learning project predicts the winning probability of an ODI match based on the current match situation. It takes inputs such as the batting team, bowling team, target, current score, overs, and more. The required ODI match data was sourced from Kaggle. After preprocessing the data, a model was trained using the RandomForestClassifier.
